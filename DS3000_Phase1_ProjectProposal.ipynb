    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "What makes a marketing video go viral on YouTube? Businesses invest millions in video marketing campaigns, but understanding what \n",
    "exactly drives engagement is more complicated. For this project, I'm interested in finding out whether \n",
    "factors like video length, upload timing, or channel characteristics can predict \n",
    "a video's success in terms of views, likes, and comments. My analysis will address two key questions:\n",
    "1. What video characteristics (duration, upload day, channel subscribers) \n",
    "   correlate most strongly with high engagement rates?\n",
    "2. Can we classify marketing videos as \"high-performing\" vs \"low-performing\" \n",
    "   based on their metadata features?\n",
    "   \n",
    "These questions have practical business applications like if marketing teams can optimize \n",
    "their content strategy by understanding which video characteristics drive engagement, \n",
    "and if brands can better allocate their advertising budgets by predicting campaign success. \n",
    "The insights from this project could help me understand how companies improve their ROI on video \n",
    "marketing investments."

    "I plan to use the YouTube Data API to collect data on marketing campaign videos. \n",
    "The API provides access to video metadata including view counts, likes, comments, \n",
    "duration, publish dates, and channel information. This data is returned in JSON \n",
    "format and can be easily parsed into a structured dataset. The YouTube API is free to use with a daily quota limit, and I've shown below how I can access the relevant data. I've collected information on marketing-related \n",
    "videos by searching for terms like \"marketing campaign,\" \"brand advertisement,\" and \n",
    "\"company promotional video.\" The data includes both numeric features (views, likes, \n",
    "comments, duration) and categorical features (channel name, publish day, category) \n",
    "that will be useful for answering my questions of interest. The complete data collection code has been run and the resulting dataset saved as a CSV file. Below I show a simplified version of the API calls and load the \n",
    "collected data to demonstrate it meets the project requirements."

    "comments) based on video features. This will help identify which factors are most \n",
    "important for video success. For my second question about classifying videos as high vs low performing, I will \n",
    "use classification techniques. I'll create a binary target variable based on \n",
    "engagement rates (e.g., videos above the median engagement as \"high-performing\") \n",
    "and train a model to predict this category based on video metadata.\n",
    "Some data cleaning for my data will be needed so for example: \n",
    "- Handling any missing values in like_count or comment_count (some videos disable these)\n",
    "- Converting duration_seconds into more interpretable bins (short/medium/long videos)\n",
    "- Potentially creating an \"engagement_rate\" feature that normalizes likes/comments by views\n",
    "- Considering creating features like \"time_since_upload\" to account for video age\n",
    "  \n",
    "Once the data is properly prepared, supervised machine learning methods like linear regression (for predicting \n",
    "engagement metrics) and logistic regression or decision trees (for classification) \n",
